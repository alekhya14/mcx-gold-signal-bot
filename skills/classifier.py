return a structured intraday signal.

SIGNAL RULES — requires minimum 2 of 3 confirmations:

STRONG BUY when ALL of these:
- Price above VWAP
- RSI between 50-65 (momentum but not overbought)
- EMA9 > EMA21 OR bullish MACD cross
- VWAP distance within +0.5% (not too extended)

WEAK BUY (can_buy) when 2 of these:
- Price above VWAP OR price_vs_vwap > -0.3% (close to VWAP)
- RSI between 45-65
- EMA9 > EMA21 OR MACD bullish

STRONG SELL when ALL of these:
- Price below VWAP
- RSI between 35-50 (bearish momentum, not oversold)

- Only 1 confirmation condition met

EXCEPTION — oversold bounce setup:
If RSI is between 28-35 AND price is within 0.3% of VWAP AND
VWAP cross is price_crossed_above_vwap, treat as WEAK_BUY candidate
even if other conditions are mixed. Label reason as "oversold bounce".

EXCEPTION — overbought pullback setup:
If RSI is between 65-72 AND price is within 0.3% of VWAP AND
VWAP cross is price_crossed_below_vwap, treat as WEAK_SELL candidate
even if other conditions are mixed. Label reason as "overbought pullback".

INTRADAY TARGETS — use intraday levels not daily pivots:
- BUY  target 1 : intraday high OR nearest resistance
- BUY  target 2 : intraday high + (intraday high - intraday low) × 0.5
- BUY  stop loss: intraday pivot - 0.3% OR recent swing low
- SELL target 1 : intraday low OR nearest support  
- SELL target 2 : intraday low - (intraday high - intraday low) × 0.5
- SELL stop loss: intraday pivot + 0.3% OR recent swing high
